I am a Machine and Deep Learning practitioner and work on control systems too. I graduated with a Masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in December 2015. Currently, I am working as a Research Engineer for Autonomous Driving at Ford Motor Company located in Dearborn, Michigan. In my previous job, I served as Software Controls Engineer for EPS systems at ZF TRW.
